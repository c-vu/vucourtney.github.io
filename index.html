				<p class = "blurb"> I'm currently in my second year as an undergrad at UC Berkeley, studying Computer Science (and maybe something else? tbd?). I like when things look nice, so I'm into learning about front-end development and UI/UX. Also into technology and how it can improve the human experience. <br> <br>

				I think customer service is interesting, particularly optimizations of processes, improvements in efficiency, and the personal interactions that machines can never replace. I also think the idea of improving the academic experience for students at such a large university is interesting. </p>

				<div class = "photo" id = "proj_right0"> <!-- logisim photo --> </div>
				<p class = "blurb_title"> MIPS Assembler/Linker and CPU </p>
				<p class = "blurb"> C program that parses MIPS pseudo-instructions and translates them into TAL assembly code and hexadecimal machine instructions. The linker (written in MIPS) turns machine instructions into an executable file by relocating symbols. <br> <br>

				Created a virtual central processing unit that takes hexadecimal machine instructions and performs arithmetic, register writes, and memory writes to fully functionally execute MIPS instructions. Pipelined the CPU to increase performance. <br> </p>

				<div class = "photo" id = "proj_right1"> <!-- data photo --> </div>
				<p class = "blurb"> <br> Java program that alphabetically sorts words in input files given a customizable alphabet. Uses the trie data structure to do so. <br> <br> Using this alphabet, it uses ternary search tries, priority queues, and data on word frequency to find top matches for user-inputted word prefixes (essentially giving autocomplete suggestions). </p>

				<a name = "code"> </a>
				<p class = "title"> How I Code </p>

				<p class = "blurb"> Check out my <a href = "https://github.com/vucourtney"> GitHub </a> account here! <br> <br>

				My programming languages of choice are Python and Java, but I'm also very adept at C. <br> <br>

				Proficient in HTML/CSS and Javascript but still learning (such as through improving this website). Also proficient in Latex. <br> <br>

				I'm always looking to learn more... </p>
