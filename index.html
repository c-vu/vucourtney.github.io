				<p class = "blurb"> I'm currently in my second year as an undergrad at UC Berkeley, studying Computer Science (and maybe something else? tbd?). I like when things look nice, so I'm into learning about front-end development and UI/UX. Also into technology and how it can improve the human experience. <br> <br>

				I think customer service is interesting, particularly optimizations of processes, improvements in efficiency, and the personal interactions that machines can never replace. I also think the idea of improving the academic experience for students at such a large university is interesting. </p>
