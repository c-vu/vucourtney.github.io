				<p class = "blurb"> I'm currently in my third year as an undergrad at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science.  <br> <br>

				One of my passions is improving the educational experience for undergraduates at large public universities such as Berkeley. As an Undergraduate Student Instructor for a 700 student (and growing) lower division CS course, I focus on understanding how our teaching staff can give each student opportunities to improve at problem solving and gain confidence. </p>

				<div class = "photo" id = "work_left"> <!-- Google Drive photo --> </div>
				<p class = "blurb_title"> Software Engineering Intern, Google </p>
				<p class = "blurb"> As part of a Google Drive backend subteam, I contributed to a new Drive product launch targeting enterprise customers. I iteratively designed and implemented a feature for this new product, with goals of helping users to quickly locate relevant documents and optimizing performance for Google Drive backend. As part of this project, I helped improve querying infrastructure in Drive to ease the retrieval of documents that users search for. <br> <br>

				The product, called Team Drives, was publicly announced recently: <a href = https://cloud.googleblog.com/2016/09/intelligent-tools-built-for-teams.html> click here to learn more </a>. </p>

				<div class = "photo" id = "proj_right0"> <!-- pagerank photo --> </div>
				<p class = "blurb_title"> PageRank: MapReduce </p>
				<p class = "blurb"> Utilizing Python Spark, this program determines the relative popularity of websites. In order to do so, it takes in inputs giving probabilities that users will stay on a given site, randomly follow a link from their current site to a new site, request to access a previous site, or randomly go to a new site. <br> <br>

				The algorithm works through a graph model that treates each webpage as a node and each link from page to page as a directed edge, using backedges to represent the user returning to a previous page. It then updates the relative weights of all sites in the given dataset, performing many iterations as the weights of sites are transferred based on user behavior probabilities. Heavier weights correspond to more popular pages and will be listed higher. </p>

				<div class = "photo" id = "proj_left1"> <!-- logisim photo --> </div>
				<p class = "blurb_title"> MIPS Assembler/Linker and CPU </p>
				<p class = "blurb"> C program that parses MIPS pseudo-instructions and translates them into TAL assembly code and hexadecimal machine instructions. The linker (written in MIPS) turns machine instructions into an executable file by relocating symbols. <br> <br>

				Created a virtual central processing unit that takes hexadecimal machine instructions and performs arithmetic, register writes, and memory writes to fully execute MIPS instructions. Pipelined the CPU to improve performance. <br> </p>

				<div class = "photo" id = "proj_right2"> <!-- data photo --> </div>
				<p class = "blurb_title"> Alphabet Sort and Autocomplete </p>
				<p class = "blurb"> Java program that alphabetically sorts words in input files given a customizable alphabet. Uses the trie data structure to do so. <br> <br> With this alphabet, it leverages ternary search tries, priority queues, and data on word frequency to find top matches for user-inputted word prefixes (essentially giving autocomplete suggestions). </p>

				<a name = "code"> </a>

				<p class = "blurb"> Check out my <a href = "https://github.com/vucourtney"> GitHub </a> account (including this website's source code) here! <br> <br>

				I have had the most experience in Python and Java, as I've worked with both in corporate codebases and completed many side projects in both languages. <br> <br>

				I have worked on multiple projects for Android mobile and smartwatch development, focusing primarily on Human Computer Interaction. This includes designing UIs, creating interfaces on the front end, and implementing application functionality on the back end.

				I am also proficient in C, HTML/CSS, and Javascript but still learning. <br> <br> </p>
